Project Overview
In this project we tried to classify the severity of road accidents based off of different factors (sex, weather, time of day,etc). The data was collected from vehicle collisions in Ethiopia ranging from 2017-2020.

Road accidents are one of the major causes of unnatural deaths around the world. We used Machine Learning with the objecting of measuring how influential certain factors can be in accidents taking place in the hopes of reducing the amount and severity in the future.
